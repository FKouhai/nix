### Current Status

The configuration appears to be approaching a stable state after addressing the core infrastructure issues. The multi-monitor setup is properly defined with correct Hyprland monitor syntax, all required variables are present, and module arguments are properly propagated through the flake system.

## Update: October 23, 2025 - Configuration Successfully Activated

After systematic debugging, the NixOS configuration has been successfully built and activated. Final resolution required the following changes:

**Final Configuration Changes:**
- Removed `snes9x-gtk` overlay entry from flake.nix
- Temporarily disabled nixvim module import in home.nix to break circular dependencies
- Added `extraSpecialArgs = { inherit inputs vars; }` to home-manager configuration in flake.nix
- Removed duplicate `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree` from hosts/cerberus/configuration.nix
- Applied `toString` conversion to all integer monitor values in hyprland.nix
- Added `isDesktop = true` to vars.nix for hyprpanel battery widget logic
- Added wallpaper URL pointing to NixOS catppuccin-mocha artwork
- Cleared conflicting Home Manager backup files

**Build Result:**
The system successfully activated with configuration located at:
`/nix/store/i3xss6d0s3lsy9cnm50bhygwm9ix25sy-nixos-system-cerberus-nix-25.11.20251016.bcef44a`

**Known Considerations:**
- nixvim integration remains disabled pending proper module structure to avoid infinite recursion
- Monitor configuration defines two monitors (DP-1 and HDMI-A-1) but hardware scan shows three DisplayPort monitors active
- Wallpaper references GitHub URL; may need local download depending on hyprpaper configuration requirements
